<b>Note:</b><br />
Many motorcycles require you to balance ridiculous amounts of power on two wheels. For beginners 650ccs is pushing the recommendable engine size, and more than two cylinders results in more sudden throttle response which is good for tossing you.<br />

<b>My Background:</b><br />
Motorcycling has been my primary form of transportation since I purchased my first bike in September 2004.
