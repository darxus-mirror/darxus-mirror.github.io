"If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude. See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective. Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor." <br /><br />                - <a href="http://www.geocities.com/~freereligion/1emerson.html">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>
