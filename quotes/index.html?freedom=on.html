"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!" - Barry Morris Goldwater, acceptance Speech as the 1964 Republican Presidential candidate<hr />
"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." - (unconfirmed) Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States<hr />
"No substitute for live fire."<hr />
"The price of freedom is the willingness to do sudden battle, anywhere, at any time, and with utter recklessness." - The Puppet Masters by Robert A. Heinlein<hr />
"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed — and hence clamorous to be led to safety — by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." - H. L. Mencken (1880 – 1956)<hr />
"Liberty is maintained by the continued differences and oppositions of numbers, not by their concurring zeal in behalf of an equitable government." - 7:17, file 6, first disk, The Cato Institute Home Study course

"[Art.] 10. [Right of Revolution.] Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security, of the whole community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind." - <a href="http://www.state.nh.us/constitution/billofrights.html">New Hampshire State Constitution, Bill of Rights, 1784</a>
<hr />
"If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy." - James Madison (4th president of the U.S.) 
<hr />
"Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar." - falsely attributed to Julius Caesar (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/caesar.htm">snopes</a>)<hr />
"Gunfire is the sound of freedom" - Rock Gallotti, Armorer for Matrix: Reloaded
<hr />
"Naturally, the common people don't want war....  But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along....  That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger." - Hermann Goering, Nazi Reichsmarshall and Luftwaffe-Chief at the Nuremberg trials, 4/18/1946  (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/goering.htm">snopes</a>)

<hr />
"All political power is inherent in the people and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness. For the advancement of these ends, they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish their government as they may think proper." - <a href="http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html">Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a>, Article 1:  Delcaration of Rights, Section 2: Political Powers
<hr />
"Using cross-sectional time-series data for U.S. counties from 1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes, without increasing accidental deaths. If those states without right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, county- and state-level data indicate that approximately 1,500 murders would have been avoided yearly. Similarly, we predict that rapes would have declined by over 4,000, robbery by over 11,000, and aggravated assaults by over 60,000." - Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns By John R. Lott, Jr., and David B. Mustard

"Come on, you sons of bitches! Do you want to live forever?" GySgt. Daniel Daly, USMC
<hr />
<a id="war_ugly"></a>"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war, is worse.  When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people.  A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice - a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice - is often the means of their regeneration.  A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.  As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the one against the other." - John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), "The Contest in America." Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 24, Issue 143, page 683-684.  Harper &amp; Bros., New York, April 1862.

"Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart...."<br />"Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide...."<br />"Sing your death song and die like a hero going home."<br />- Tecumseh, Shawnee

"It is a good day to die."
<hr />
"Thinking men cannot be ruled."  - Ayn Rand
<hr />
"Always place your clothes and weapons where you can find them in the dark" - Lazarus Long in Time Enough for Love by Robert A. Heinlein
<hr />
"Gun Control: The proposition that a woman found dead in an alley, raped and strangled with her own panty hose, is more acceptable than allowing that same woman to defend herself with a firearm." 
<hr />
"A strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the high virtues of a good citizen, but it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation." - Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), U.S. president. Letter, 20 Sept. 1810.

<a name="democracy" />"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising them the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal responsibility, always followed by a dictatorship. The average of the world's great civilizations before they decline has been 200 years.  These nations have progressed in this sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; from spiritual faith to great courage; from courage to liberty; from liberty to abundance; from abundance to selfishness; from selfishness to complacency; from complacency to apathy; from apathy to dependency; from dependency back again to bondage." - Unknown, <i>not</i> Alexander Tyler, (in his 1770 book, Cycle of Democracy )  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/tyler.asp">snopes</a>
<hr />
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." - <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=802&amp;chapter=86685&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#a_1991608">Thomas Jefferson, November 13th, 1787, letter to William Smith</a> - worth reading
<hr />
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." - Emiliano Zapata, Mexican Revolution Leader
<hr />
"With a prayer in my mouth I dashed unarmed through a line of soldiers, my clothes were cut to pieces, my horse was wounded but I was not hurt, as I reached the door of my lodge my wife handed me my rifle saying<br /><br />'here's your gun...fight'"<br /><br />- Joseph, Nez Perce
<hr />
&lt;enbloc&gt; it's a crying shame here - under the clinton administration they basically turned freon into a controlled substance no different than heroin<br /> &lt;enbloc&gt; I wonder sometimes if it won't be toilets and freon that finally motivate the people to start shooting<br /> &lt;Balder&gt; toilets?<br /> &lt;enbloc&gt; tank capacity limits. basically you gotta flush twice<br /> &lt;Balder&gt; you've got regulations on toilet tank capacity?<br /> * enbloc sobs. yes. in the land of the supposedly free<br /> * Balder will rethink his emigration ideas more than once after this.
<hr />

[...] To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them." - Senator Richard Henry Lee, 1788, on "militia" in the 2nd Amendment
