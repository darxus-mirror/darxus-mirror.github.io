"And I got these stunning rushes of pure timeless joy, when my consciousness seemed to expand outwards from the limits of my skin to fill the universe and I could no longer tell whether I was playing the music or the music was playing me." - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/dancing.html">Eric S. Raymond</a>, 1995<hr />
"When music affects us to tears, seemingly causeless, we weep not, as Gravina supposes, from 'excess of pleasure'; but through excess of an impatient, petulant sorrow that, as mere mortals, we are as yet in no condition to banquet upon those supernal ecstasies of which the music affords us merely a suggestive and indefinite glimpse." - Edgar Allan Poe, The Unknown Poe<hr />
"Let's show the bastards we're ready to go down dancing." - <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0241303/">Chocolat</a>
<hr />
"Life may not be the party we were hoping for, but as long as we're here, we might as well dance." - anonymous
<hr />
"Anyone who says sunshine brings happiness has never danced in the rain." - Source unknown 
<hr />
"I don't want people who want to dance, I want people who have to dance." - George Balanchine
<hr />
"I can see inside you, the sickness is rising, don't try to deny what you feel" - down with the sickness, disturbed
<hr />
"God sent me to piss the world off" - Eminem
<hr />
"If you didn't come to party than you should go home."
<hr />
"If you haven't danced yet, what the fuck did you come for ?"

<blockquote><div>If you ain't tryin to live, you with the wrong crowd<br /> And if you feelin brave then better sport that thong proud<br /> And if you finally breathin, then sing this song loud<br /> I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought<br /> Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all<br /> I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin less for y'all<br /> Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you whylin<br /> And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin </div></blockquote> - Bubba Sparxxx

"I would believe only in a God that knows how to Dance." <br /><br />  - <a href="http://obits.com/Nietzsche.html">Nietzsche</a>
