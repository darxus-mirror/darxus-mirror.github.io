“There is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody. You built a factory out there - good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory... Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.” ― Elizabeth Warren<hr />
"The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every class is unfit to govern." - Lord Acton<hr />
"Obama is wrong. Government cannot force you to pay for something that violates faith or beliefs. Govt has no right to do this." - <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ricksantorum">Rick Santorum</a>, twitter, 2011-02-13
<hr />
"Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God." - Benjamin Franklin, first draft of the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States
<hr />
"The lesser of two evils is still evil." - Jerry Garcia
<hr />
"Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action." - George Washington (unverified)
<hr />
"It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority." - Benjamin Franklin (unverified)<hr />
"One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors." - Plato<hr />
"All political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit. The faith of the people of Texas stands pledged to the preservation of a republican form of government, and, subject to this limitation only, they have at all times the inalienable right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient." - (all of) <a href="http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000100-000200.html">The Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 2</a>
<hr />
"Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard." - H. L. Mencken
<hr />
"'Did you really think we want those laws observed?' said Dr. Ferris. 'We want them to be broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against... We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted -- and you create a nation of law-beakers -- and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.'" - Atlas Shrugged, 1957, Ayn Rand<hr />
"The word 'politics' is derived from the word 'poly', meaning 'many', and the word 'ticks', meaning 'blood sucking parasites'." - Larry Hardiman<hr />
"Anarchy is based on the observation that since few are fit to rule themselves, even fewer are fit to rule others." - Edward Abbey 
<hr />
"Take away the right to say 'fuck' and you take away the right to say 'fuck the government.'" - Lenny Bruce<hr />
"Blood alone moves the wheels of history."  - Mussolini
<hr />
"A little <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=revolution">revolution</a>, now and then, is a healthy thing..." - Captain Marko Ramius - '<a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=the+hunt+for+red+october">The Hunt for Red October</a>' (by Tom Clancy)
<hr />
"To misquote <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=bruce+sterling">Bruce Sterling</a>, being afraid of large companies especially when they're getting into the <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=isp">ISP</a> business is like being afraid of large gorillas especially when they're on fire." <br />- Michael Handler (handler@netaxs.com) Email: support@netaxs.com<br />Net Access System Administration, ~1995

<hr />
"No man is good nor wise enough, to rule another or disown the rights of every woman and man to live and let live, and be left alone.  I talk about abortion. I say 'Fuck the Government'.  Does that offend you?  Good!  I respect no government who will make any law that restricts speech, in any medium.  I will be offensive, and I will take offense at what others say, BUT I WILL DEFEND TO THE DEATH THEIR RIGHT TO BE OFFENSIVE."

Cyberspace Hashishim Declare <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=jihad">Jihad</a>  <br /><br />  "We declare Jihad, a Holy War, against those who call for the regulation of the Net by government occupational forces. We will cut off their heads and fill their dead open mouths with shit, and impale their skulls on pikes, lighting the whole thing ablaze with flaming torches."   <br /><br />  -Mahmud Abd Al-Shakir Cyberspace Hashishim (found at <a href="http://www.onworld.com/MUT/elecGur.html">http://www.onworld.com/MUT/elecGur.html</a>)
