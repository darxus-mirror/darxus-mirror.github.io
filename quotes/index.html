The word was coined by Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and privileged in others. It is an intersectional extension of the idea of patriarchy beyond gender.[1] Kyriarchy encompasses sexism, racism, homophobia, classism, economic injustice, colonialism, ethnocentrism, militarism, and other forms of dominating hierarchies in which the subordination of one person or group to another is internalized and institutionalized." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">wikipedia</a><hr />

You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory... Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God bless! Keep a hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.” ― Elizabeth Warren<hr />

Don't believe in them.'"<br /> <br /> - The Barn at the End of the World, page 189<hr />

Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties.

Often.<br /> You didn't come here to be perfect. You already are.<br /> You came here to be gorgeously human. Flawed and fabulous.<br /> And then to rise again into remembering.<br /> But unconditional love? Stop telling that story.<br /> Love, in truth, doesn't need ANY other adjectives.<br /> It doesn't require modifiers.<br /> It doesn't require the condition of perfection.<br /> It only asks that you show up. And do your best.<br /> That you stay present and feel fully.<br /> That you shine and fly and laugh and cry<br /> and hurt and heal and fall and get back up<br /> and play and work and live and die as YOU.<br /> It's enough. It's Plenty." - Courtney A. Walsh<hr />

For surely anyone who achieves anything is, essentially, abnormal." - Dr. Karl Menninger, The Human Mind, 1930<hr />

If those states without right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, county- and state-level data indicate that approximately 1,500 murders would have been avoided yearly. Similarly, we predict that rapes would have declined by over 4,000, robbery by over 11,000, and aggravated assaults by over 60,000." - Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns By John R.

<a id="war_ugly"></a>"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war, is worse.  When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people.  A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice - a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice - is often the means of their regeneration.  A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.  As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the one against the other." - John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), "The Contest in America."

<a name="democracy" />"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising them the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal responsibility, always followed by a dictatorship. The average of the world's great civilizations before they decline has been 200 years.  These nations have progressed in this sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; from spiritual faith to great courage; from courage to liberty; from liberty to abundance; from abundance to selfishness; from selfishness to complacency; from complacency to apathy; from apathy to dependency; from dependency back again to bondage." - Unknown, <i>not</i> Alexander Tyler, (in his 1770 book, Cycle of Democracy )  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/tyler.asp">snopes</a>

"If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude. See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective. Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor." <br /><br />                - <a href="http://www.geocities.com/~freereligion/1emerson.html">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>

"The Party said that <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=oceania">Oceania</a> had never been in alliance with Eurasia.  He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.  But where did that knowledge exist?  Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.  And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -- if all records told the same tale -- the lie passed into history and became truth.  'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future:  Who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.  Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting.  It was quite simple.  All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory.

"Winston was dreaming...."<br /> "The girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the field.  With  what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them  disdainfully aside.  Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no  desire in him; indeed, he barely looked at it.  What overwhelmed him in  that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her  clothes aside.  With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a  whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=big+brother">Big Brother</a> and the  Party and the <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=thought+police">Thought Police</a> could all be swept into nothingness by a  single splendid movement of the arm.
