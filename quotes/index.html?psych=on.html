"Dear Human: You've got it all wrong.<br /> You didn't come here to master unconditional love.<br /> That is where you came from and where you'll return.<br /> You came here to learn personal love.<br /> Universal love. Messy love. Sweaty love.<br /> Crazy love. Broken love. Whole love.<br /> Infused with divinity. Lived through the grace of stumbling.<br /> Demonstrated through the beauty of... messing up. Often.<br /> You didn't come here to be perfect. You already are.<br /> You came here to be gorgeously human. Flawed and fabulous.<br /> And then to rise again into remembering.<br /> But unconditional love? Stop telling that story.<br /> Love, in truth, doesn't need ANY other adjectives.<br /> It doesn't require modifiers.<br /> It doesn't require the condition of perfection.<br /> It only asks that you show up. And do your best.<br /> That you stay present and feel fully.<br /> That you shine and fly and laugh and cry<br /> and hurt and heal and fall and get back up<br /> and play and work and live and die as YOU.<br /> It's enough. It's Plenty." - Courtney A. Walsh<hr />

"We all enter this world in the same way: <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=naked">naked</a>; <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=screaming">screaming</a>; soaked in <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=blood">blood</a>.

For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=new+york">New York</a>, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=good+time">good time</a>. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons." - the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy

<hr />
"The Party said that <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=oceania">Oceania</a> had never been in alliance with Eurasia.  He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.  But where did that knowledge exist?  Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.  And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -- if all records told the same tale -- the lie passed into history and became truth.  'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future:  Who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.  Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting.  It was quite simple.  All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory.  'Reality control,' they called it; in <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=newspeak">Newspeak</a>, '<a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=doublethink">doublethink</a>.'"  <br /><br />  - <a href="http://www2.itexas.net/~jburks/1984.htm">1984</a> by <a href="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/orwell.htm">George Orwell</a>

"Winston was dreaming...."<br /> "The girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the field.  With  what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them  disdainfully aside.  Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no  desire in him; indeed, he barely looked at it.  What overwhelmed him in  that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her  clothes aside.  With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a  whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=big+brother">Big Brother</a> and the  Party and the <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=thought+police">Thought Police</a> could all be swept into nothingness by a  single splendid movement of the arm.  That too was a gesture belonging to  the ancient time.  Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his  lips." <br /><br />  - <a href="http://www2.itexas.net/~jburks/1984.htm">1984</a> by <a href="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/orwell.htm">George Orwell</a>
