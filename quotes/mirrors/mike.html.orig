<P>My quote file is now split into three pieces.  This page, a 
<A HREF="bigquotes.html">Big Quotes page</A>, and an 
<A HREF="ircquotes.html">IRC Quotes page</A>.</P>  

<P>The reason is because I'm using this file as a source for quotes 
in the IRC bot I wrote recently, and full-page quotes get kinda 
annoying in an IRC channel.  Plus the IRC quotes don't work too well
in IRC either.</P>
