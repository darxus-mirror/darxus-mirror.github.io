<br> To the few experiences which helped me along the way
<br> toward my life's true goal I added this new one: the
<br> observation of such configurations [staring at a fire,
<br> tree roots, veins in rock, smoke, clouds, water,
<br> reflections, light, dust, swirling specks of light when
<br> eyes are closed].
<br> The surrender to Nature's irrational, strangely confused
<br> formations produces in us a feeling of inner harmony with
<br> the force responsible for these phenomena.  We soon fall
<br> prey to the temptation of thinking of them as being our
<br> own moods, our own creations, and see the boundaries
<br> seperating us from Nature begin to quiver and dissolve.
<br> We become acquainted with that state of mind in which
<br> we are unable to decide whether the images on our retina
<br> are the result of impressions coming from without or
<br> from within.  Nowhere as in this exercise can we discover
<br> so easily and simply to what extent we are creative, to what
<br> extent our soul partakes of the constant creation of
<br> the world.  For it is the same indivisible divinity
<br> that is active through us and in Nature, and if the
<br> outside world were to be destroyed, a single one of us
<br> would be capable of rebuilding it: mountain and stream,
<br> tree and leaf, root and flower, yes, every natural
<br> form is latent within us, originates in the soul whose
<br> essence is eternity, whose essence we cannot know but
<br> which most often intimates itself to us as the power
<br> to love and create.
<br>   The next time we were together, the organist gave me
<br> an explanation: "We always define the limits of our
<br> personality too narrowly.  In general, we count as part
<br> of our personality only that which we can recognise as
<br> being an individual trait or as diverging from the norm.
<br> But we consist of everything the world consists of, each
<br> of us, and just as our body contains the genealogical table
<br> of evolution as far back as the fish and even much further,
<br> so we bear everything in our soul that once was alive in
<br> the soul of men.  Every god and devil that ever existed,
<br> be it among the Greeks, Chinese, or Zulus, are within us,
<br> exist as latent possibilities, as wishes, as alternatives.
<br> If the human race were to vanish from the face of the earth
<br> save for one halfway talented child that had received no
<br> education, this child would rediscover the entire course
<br> of evolution, it would be capable of producing everything
<br> once more, gods and demons, paradises, commandments, the
<br> Old and New Testament."
<br>   "Yes, fine," I replied.  "But what is the value of the
<br> individual in that case?  Why do we continue striving if
<br> everything has been completed within us?"
<br>   "Stop!" exclaimed Pistorius.  "There's an immense
<br> difference between simply carrying the world within us
<br> and being aware of it.  A madman can spout ideas that
<br> remind you of Plato, and a pious little seminary student
<br> rethinks deep mythological correspondences found among
<br> the Gnostics or in Zoroaster.  But he isn't aware of them.
<br> He is a tree or stone, at best an animal, as long as he is not
<br> conscious.  But as soon as the first spark of recognition
<br> dawns within him he is a human being.  You wouldn't
<br> consider all the bipeds you pass on the street human
<br> beings simply because they walk upright and carry their
<br> young in their bellies nine months!  It is obvious how
<br> many of them are fish or sheep, worms or angels, how
<br> many are ants, how many are bees!  Well, each one of
<br> them contains the possibility of becoming human, but
<br> only by having an intimation of these possibilities,
<br> partially even by learning to make himself conscious
<br> of them; only in this respect are these possibilities his."

<br> Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours -is- the only world.  Well,
