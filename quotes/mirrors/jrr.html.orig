        <I>"This class is definitely open to beginners" Don't mind that guy drooling on himself in the corner he just landed                  on his head, and the fellow bleeding profusely from his nose simply must learn not to run full speed into sensei's                  clenched fist".</I> -- Unknown<BR><BR>

Telecommunications                            systems, power grid systems, financial systems all going down at the exact same time. Whether its from next door            or halfway across the world, the capability to do this exists today."</I> -- Jim Settle, the form chief of the FBI's         computer crimes squad.<BR><BR>

Quotes from "Slaves of the Machine" by Gregory J.E. Rawlins:
<HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=15%>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <I>"Fewer than four hundred two-state switches, have more states than there are atoms in the entire universe."</I>
        <I>"Unlike letters in libraries, however, the smallest components of even the worlds largest computers are made                       out of the simplest possible parts - tiny pieces of fused sand."</I><BR><BR>
        <I>"Watching a chip work, we seem to hear the lilt of a soaring dream.  Its the Twentieth - Centurys Mandala, an                      icon of our struggle to achieve order over chaos, an image of our world written in sand with crystalline grace,                             intricate and beautiful:  information made touchable."</I><BR><BR>
        <I>"In our quest for ever more speed we may eventually fuse computers and biology into a single new technology                        by engineering molecular machines.  That development took a long step forward in 1981, when two IBM scientists                      made a microscope that let us see and move single atoms.  Five years later they got the Nobel Prize.  Similar        microscopes are now teacup-sized and available commercially.  Then, in 1990, IBM took hours and used a massive       cooling system to write the letters I-B-M using single atoms.  Less than a year later, Hitachi could do similar things -     but in seconds, and at room temperature.  By 1992, researchers were building conducting wires one molecule                   thick.  By 1995, others were building simple motors almost the size of molecules.  By 1996, yet others were                                 connecting those motors together."</I><BR><BR>
        <I>"Already, computers make computers; theyre quickly shoving us out of their almost fully automated and almost       totally dust-free factories.  Were becoming brood hens, more and more puzzled by the curious eggs we keep    laying.  Eventually, none of us may know exactly whats in any computer.  Year by year, were rapidly gaining                  power and, just as rapidly, losing control.  Theres only one similar process in all our experience - a thermonuclear        explosion."</I><BR><BR>
        <I>"Theres a special fierce joy in programming computers today that non-programmers simply cant                                       comprehend
Some of the best computer programs we have today are simply elegant poems told in                                     logic."</I><BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <I>"What we have here is attempted governance by the completely clueless, in a place they've never been, using                        tools they don't possess...The audacity of these people to claim moral right to govern an area where they've never                  even been is stupefying."</I> -- John Perry Barlow, Co-Founder Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).<BR><BR>
        <I>"One computer will do as it is told.  But a million computers linked together, responding to the needs and                                 desires and obsessions of a million people, will not.  A network is inherently unstable.  The Web will be ever                              restless.  It is at no one's beck or call.  And no matter how many times software protocols are patched or how                              many loopholes are plugged, no engineer, or team of engineers, will ever finish the job.  The Net may be self-       balancing, but it is never in balance.  No organic system is truly in balance.  It may strive for balance, it may                            continually seek equilibrium, but it will never actually achieve it."</I> -- Page 186, 1st Paragraph, BOTS by Andrew                        Leonard<BR><BR>
