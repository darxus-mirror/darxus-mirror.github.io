<h1>How to pillion</h1>

<p>
You really can just tell the rider to take it easy, get on, and ride. It's
not hard. These are just a bunch of tips to make it more pleasant for
everybody.
</p>

<h2>Most important</h2>

<p>
Shifting weight around causes a bike to steer toward the direction you lean
(although less effectively than pressing the handlebars), so how you shift
your weight around matters.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, do not make any sudden movements. For example, if the
rider is turning left, in front of an oncoming car, do not take this
opportunity to lunge hard to the right to ask them what the hell they are
thinking. That will make it much harder for them to avoid colliding with
the car.
</p>

<p>
If you drop something, don't lunge for it.
</p>

<h2>Mounting and sitting</h2>

<p>
Before getting on, be sure the rider is ready. This is a substantial weight
shift that will make it a lot more difficult to hold the bike up if they're
not ready.  
</p>

<p>
I think the best thing to hold on to is the rider's waist. There may be a
grab bar behind you, which could be useful. Holding on with your knees is
apparently also useful.
</p>

<p>
To get on from the left side, while the rider is bracing the bike, put your
left foot on the left peg (either yours or the rider's), then swing your right
leg over the bike.  
</p>

<h2>While riding</h2>

<p>
If you're going to sit perfectly still relative to anything, let it be
relative to the bike. So if you look at you and the bike from the back, you
keep your body in line with the bike when it leans. Do not sit up straight
relative to the road, since that will result in you actively leaning the
wrong way, and the rider will have to steer harder.
</p>

<p>
A better option is to look over the rider's low side shoulder. When a bike
turns, it leans over, and the side of the bike closest to the ground is the
low side. Look over the shoulder on the side closest to the ground. (The
other side is the high side.) Again, if you find yourself on the wrong
side, don't move suddenly.

<p>
Try to relax your body. The stiffer you are, the more you will get bounced
around. Especially on highways. If you know a bump is coming, you can
absorb some of the shock with your legs by pushing down on the foot pegs a
little.
</p>

<h2>Slowing and stopping</h2>

<p>
When slowing down, it can be very nice to avoid squishing the rider into
the gas tank by putting your hands on the gas tank and supporting yourself.
</p>

<p>
Try to avoid whacking your helmets together.
</p>

<p>
Motorcycles are more stable at high speeds, and less stable at low speeds.
It can be very tempting to shift around as you're coming to a stop, but
that's the worst time to do it. At highway speeds, if you can confirm
you're not about to turn in any way, you can get up and dance around, shake
your legs out, whatever.
</p>

<h2>Physical safety</h2>

<p>
Understand the consequences of not wearing lots of armor. I tend to wear
about as little as is legally allowed, but it's important to understand
that pavement does really unpleasant things to bodies at highway speeds,
and regular clothing counts for basically nothing. A very responsible
option might be a full face helmet, full armor suit (jacket and pants,
preferably attached), gloves, and boots.
</p>

<p>
Keep clear of the exhaust, it gets incredibly hot, and may be very close to
your foot pegs. Headers can burn bare skin instantly, and melted shoe is a
real pain to clean off.
</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>
Ask the rider how long they've been riding, how much experience they have with
pillions, how long they've been riding the exact bike you're riding, and what
sort of crash history they have. For example, I've been riding since 2004, I've
been riding my <a href="../xx/index.html">XX</a> since 2006, have
ridden with pillions a bunch, and have dropped bikes three times: Two at about
0 mph, and one on a race track where I was intentionally pushing the limits of
traction.
</p>

<p>
Establishing methods of communication by tapping and gesturing can be
really useful. Like when you get on the bike, a couple taps to indicate
you're ready to go. Or a couple taps and then pointing at a place you want
to stop, or maybe pointing down to indicate that you need to pull over
immediately.
</p>

<p>
Talk about your feelings about speed. People have very different feelings
about the sensation of nearly falling off the back of the bike under hard
acceleration. Even varying from day to day. From mortal terror, to cackling
with glee.
</p>

<h2>Zeph's advice</h2>

<p>
I think the most useful pillion experience I had was that the second time I
rode, I closed my eyes and tried to figure out what felt right.  After I
got the hang of what felt right, I started opening my eyes to see what
position we were in at various times.
</p>

<p>
I noticed I was keeping my center of gravity very low in my belly, and
aligning my spine such that it was perpendicular to the force of gravity
<i>by feel</i>.  This leads to an image in my mind of toy racetracks that curve
sideways on turns to account for the way momentum interacts with gravity to
create a force vector that is diagonal between the two.
</p>

<p>
In spending time with my eyes closed, I also found I could angle my spine
forward and back to deal with acceleration and deceleration, which meant
I did not have to hold as tightly to the driver during those times.  I
still always have my hands ready to hang on, but I've noticed drivers
appreciate when I can absorb most of the Newtonian physics using the
structure of my body, instead of just my hands.
</p>

<p>
Because of this experience, I would definitely recommend riders new to
pillion should try very hard to spend some time with their eyes closed.
Even if they are uncomfortable, perhaps especially if they are
uncomfortable, decreasing the sensory input involved will help their bodies
pay more attention to what feels stable.
