    </ul>I have heard numerous people comment that Classic Pistol is the nicest
    range in the Philadelphia area. It is indoor, well ventilated, and the
    target holding things work well. The employees are nice and helpful. Their
    ammo prices are reasonable. They have 15 lanes, 5 of which long guns are
    allowed in (at an extra price), including full-auto and shotguns. They are
    also a small gun shop. They carry everything you would need for a day at
    the range, including reasonably priced ammo. They have a nice selection of
    guns for sale and rental - including 2 <a href=
    "http://www.hkpro.com/mp5.htm">H&amp;K MP5</a>s, and a <a href=
    "http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/PSharpe1.html">Thompson</a>.I bought a 1
    year membership, and I've purchased 3 of my 4 guns there.

    <p>I originally discovered CP while looking for local <a href=
    "http://www.idpa.com">IDPA (International Defensive Pistol Association)</a>
    competitions - which CP hosts every 3rd Tuesday of the month.</p>

    <p>I have had quite an <a href="slr95ship.html">ordeal trying to get an
    SLR95</a> through them. As a result, I intend to give them as little of my
    business as possible.</p>

    free outdoor range</h2>

    </ul>Doug recently introduced me to a wonderful phenominon - a free outdoor
    range near Nockamixon Park. It's on route 563, north of route 313. It is
    hard to find. You can set up targets at 25, 50, and 100 yards. Hours are
    8am - sunset mon-fri, and noon - sunset on sunday. There is no staff. The
    people there were friendly and seemed sufficiently safety concious. The
    target holding things work well - they are some kind of heavy fabric
    hanging from boards - you need to bring tacks or a staple gun (I purchased
    a staple gun becaue of this place). Probably the worst part about this
    range is a requirement that you have no more than 3 rounds loaded at a
    time, but I consider this quite a reasonable price to pay for an otherwise
    free range. The range technically has nothing to do with Nockamixon park,
    it is part of the state game lands, but the Nockamixon Park folks seem to
    have better info on it than the Game Commision.

    <p>It used to be called "<a href=
    "http://www.shootingsports.com/twins/">Twin S</a>". Costs $15 per person
    per day (memberships are available). They have a short range where you can
    set up targets any where up to and including, I believe 50 yards. This is
    where I began sighting in. They have another range where we spent most of
    our time where you can set up targets every 100 yards up to 500. Doug and
    barry brought a bunch of water filled plastic bottles. I mostly shot at
    paper targets, trying to perfect my scope adjustments. The worst part about
    the range is the backstops - they have some rather beat up palates that you
    can attach targets to (with dirt mounds behind them). The best part was
    that the benches have a roof over them. It rained pretty substantially for
    a short time while we were there. We and our guns stayed completely dry and
    continued shooting. It may have occurred to you that 500 yards is
    <i>really</i> long - there's a stone covered road you're allowed to drive
    down to set up your targets, which is.. quite thoughtful.</p>

    <p>They also have a very nice skeet shooting set up with at least 4 very
    substantial pigeon launchers, which I must try sometime. It costs
    significantly more than the rifle range to use.</p>
