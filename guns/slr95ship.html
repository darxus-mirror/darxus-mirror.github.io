"pics/200203/tn_img_0207b.jpg" width="192" height="52" alt='slr95' /></a> On 9/7/01 I began trying to get an <a href=
"notes.html#ak">SLR95</a> (a semi-auto <a href=
"http://kalashnikov.guns.ru/models/ka50.html">AK-47</a> variant) from <a href=
"http://www.gordontechnologies.com">Gordon Technologies</a>. This was delayed a
total of 46 days, broken down by the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>19 days due to <a href="http://www.classicpistol.com">Classic Pistol</a>
company policies that they had not informed me of until after I had brought
them my money order.</li>
<li>11 days due to inability to reach <a href=
"http://www.gordontechnologies.com">Gordon Technologies</a></li>
<li>6 days making initial arrangements with <a href=
"http://www.gordontechnologies.com">Gordon Technologies</a></li>
<li>1 day delay by me to get the money order</li>
<li>9 days due to shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>A gun can only legally be shipped to someone who has an FFL (<a href=
"http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/nlc/ffl_info.htm">Federal Firearms
License</a>). The shipper does not legally need to have an FFL. Because of
convenience, and the fact that I have a membership there, I chose to have
<a href="http://www.gordontechnologies.com">Gordon Technologies</a> ship the
rifle to <a href="http://www.classicpistol.com">Classic Pistol</a>, to have
<a href="http://www.classicpistol.com">Classic Pistol</a> do the FFL transfer
to me.</p>
<p>I believe I have taken at least 16 people to shoot at <a href=
"http://www.classicpistol.com">Classic Pistol</a>'s gun range for the first
time. For all but a couple, it was their first time shooting. At least 3 of
them have purchased guns there, and at least 3 have purchased memberships. I
have a membership, and have purchased 3 guns and a case of ammunition from
them.</p>
<p>The only person whose tone became unprofessional during this was the owner
of Classic Pistol.</p>
<p>In the following description of this ordeal, I omitted a number of emails
and phone calls that were fruitless (where I got no new information).</p>

purchasing an SLR95.</td>

I recieved a call back from Jerry, we agreed on a price, etc. I called <a href=
"http://www.classicpistol.com">Classic Pistol</a>, and asked what I needed to
do with them. They said just bring in a money order to pay Gordon Technologies,
and they'd send their FFL to Gordon Technologies. I couldn't get the money
order that day, due to bank inconveniences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='date' valign="top">9/14/01</td>
<td>(1 day delay by me to get money order)<br />
I obtained the money order and stopped by Classic Pistol on the way to work.
John Ricco at Classic Pistol then informed me that he would not send their FFL
to Gordon Technologies without a faxed copy of Gordon Technologies's FFL. It
would have been nice to have known this the day before, when I asked what
needed to be done. I left the money order at Classic Pistol, to be sent with
their FFL when this issue was resolved. I asked Jerry to fax his FFL to Classic
Pistol. Jerry refused, saying that this was an unreasonable request, and that
he'd talk to Classic Pistol. Note that the point at which I got the money order
is when I paid the money for the rifle.</td>

I called Classic Pistol around 2:15pm, they said they had my rifle. They asked
when I'd arrive, I said around 4pm, they said that was fine. I drove there from
work and got there probably around 3pm - I had not notified them of my change
in plans because I did not realize there might be significant paperwork or
problems to take care of before I arrived. About 15 minutes after I arrived
they told me they could not legally transfer my rifle to me without an official
copy of Gordon Technologies's FFL. I believe this is a lie. Note, also, that
they did have a faxed copy of Gordon Technologies's FFL from before. Most of
all, I would prefer to have had them tell me or the shipper of this store
policy before the rifle was shipped. Preferably the day before I gave them my
money order, when I called to ask what needed to be done. I drove back to work.
I left Jerry voicemail and sent him email asking him to send an official copy
of his FFL to Classic Pistol. I called Classic Pistol and gave them Jerry's
phone number again. I got email from Jerry saying that Classic Pistol
<i>could</i> legally transfer the rifle to me, but that he was sending them an
official copy of his FFL anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='date' valign="top">10/15/01</td>
<td>Since Classic Pistol said they had not yet received Gordon Technologies's
FFL, I called Jerry and asked him when and how he had sent his FFL to Classic
Pistol. He basically said "I don't know, I'll send another" (by "priority mail
or something").</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='date' valign="top">10/17/01</td>
<td>I called Classic Pistol to ask if they'd gotten Gordon Technologies's FFL
yet. The person I talked to told me "The owner said in a frustrated voice 'no,
we still haven't gotten it, maybe they need to send another'". I told them
Jerry told me he did 2 days ago, by priority mail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='date' valign="top">10/19/01</td>
<td>I called Classic Pistol, they still haven't recieved Gordon Technologies's
FFL. The USPS says their <a href=
"http://www.usps.com/shipping/eps_prm.htm">Priority Mail</a> is a 2-3 day
service. Jerry had said he was sending Classic Pistol their FFL for the 2nd
time 4 days ago, so I called Jerry, and left voicemail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='date' valign="top">10/22/01</td>
<td>(13 day delay by Classic Pistol policy I was unaware of)<br />
I recieved voicemail from Classic Pistol between 1 and 2 pm: "we got gordon
technologies' ffl, you can come pick up your gun". By 4pm it was in my
posession.</td>
