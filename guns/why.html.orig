      <h1>"He who dies with the most toys<br />

    needed but stupid to be without."

    <h2>Mechanical Fascination</h2>I enjoy collecting various intricate items.
    One kind is guns. They are elegant machines which are an enjoyable
    challenge to master.

    <h2>Meditation and Physical Challenge</h2>I consider target shooting a
    wonderful form of meditation. The best I've shot was a 3" group of 6 rounds
    at 25 yards with my Kimber 1911 Compact. I've heard people describe
    specific things about how to stand and hold a gun to shoot accurately, but
    I think this is the wrong way to look at it. To shoot accurately, I believe
    all you need to do is pay attention to your body and get comfortable.

    <p>Relax. This will cause you to shake less, and be more accurate.</p>

    <p>Get comfortable. Support your body and firearm as much as possible with
    bone structure. Use your muscles in a way that will make them all as
    comfortable as possible. This will make you more structurally sound, and
    more accurate.</p>

    <p>Clear your mind and focus on your front sight and your target.</p>

    <h2>Participating in My Own Fate</h2>No one is personally accountable for
    my own safety but myself. It has been held in the highest courts of the
    United States that <a href=
    "http://members.aol.com/copcrimes/courtcases.html">no police officer is
    obligated to protect the individual</a>. I hope, and am optomistic, that
    no-one will ever seriously threaten my physical safety. But it can happen
    to anyone. And you cannot know when.

    <p>"Laws are not the answer. We have laws against murder. We have laws
    against kidnapping. We have laws against extortion. And murder, kidnapping,
    and extortion are on the rise. The answer, it seems to me, is wrath. Let
    the thug take his chances with an alert, prepared, and angry citizenry. It
    may very well spoil his whole career." - <a href=

    <p>"The defence of one's self, justly called the primary law of nature, is
    not, nor can it be abrogated by any regulation of municipal law." --- James
    Wilson, Wilson, Of the Natural Rights of Individuals, in 2 The Works of
    James Wilson 335 (J.D. Andrews ed. 1896).</p>

    <p>Self defense is a natural law, more important than any law penned by
    mankind. Owning and carrying the means to defend yourself, with lethal
    force, if necessary, follows.</p>

    <blockquote><div>
      Now this is the Law of the Jungle,<br />
      as old and as true as the sky;<br />
      And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper,<br />
      but the Wolf that shall break it must die.
    </div></blockquote>- Rudyard Kipling
