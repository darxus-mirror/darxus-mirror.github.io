<h1>Why guns are important</h1>

<p>

You might say I've lived most of my life ruled by logic.  As others are sometimes accused of being ruled by emotion.  I have recently come to the conclusion that both are unwise, and a balance is best.  This sounds reasonable, right?  Some subjects may deserve more logic, some more emotion.  

</p><p>

I suspect the main reason people object to guns is because they are considering the subject with too much emotion and not enough logic.
