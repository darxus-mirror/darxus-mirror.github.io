<h1>DNSWL spam reporting plugin for SpamAssassin</h1>

<p>
<a href="../dl/DNSWLh.pm">DNSWLh.pm</a>
</p>

<p>
Adds DNSWL to the services which receive a report via the command "spamassassin --report" (or -r).  (In addition to DCC, Pyzor, Razor, and SpamCop).  
</p><p>

<p><b>
It is very important that you use SpamAssassin's internal_networks and trusted_relay settings to indicate any trusted relays, such as proxies or mailing list servers.  Otherwise you'll report your trusted relays as spammers.
</b></p>

There is also <a href="../sa_report/index.html">a script which does not depend on SpamAssassin</a>.
</p><p>

This requires <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/selfservice/?action=register">creating an dnswl account</a> and <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/selfservice/?action=selfservice.spamreport">retrieving your reporting API token</a>.
</p><p>

Put DNSWLh.pm in something like /usr/share/perl5/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/
</p><p>

Add to your spamassassin config ($HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs):
</p><p>

loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DNSWLh<br />
dnswl_token yourtoken<br />
internal_networks [IPs you control]<br />
trusted_networks [IPs you have asked to relay mail to you, like proxies and mailing list servers]
</p><p>

trusted_networks docs:
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.3.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html#network_test_options">network test options</a>, 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/TrustPath">trust path</a>.
</p><p>

<p>I don't know if this internal / trusted networks handling is currently implimented on their end, you should probably use their web UI to provide that information.
</p>

Output tells you what IP address you reported, so you can verify your
internal_networks / trusted_networks is configured correctly.  Output looks
like:

<blockquote><tt>
  Successfully reported to DNSWL 188.116.52.141.  Current trust level is:<br />
  Unlisted.<br />
  1 message(s) examined.
</tt></blockquote>
</p><p>

You can also <a href="http://www.dnswl.org/abuse/pastreports.pl">check your DNSWL abuse report history</a>.<br />
( <a href="http://www.dnswl.org/">http//www.dnswl.org</a> / Report Abuse, Report / History )<br />
It also shows the domain we believe owns the reported IP.
Requires logging in with the username and password created above.
Unfortunately Unlisted IPs are not recorded, or shown on this page.
</p>
