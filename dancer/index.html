7 SATA ports and PCIe 4.0 cut my options down.  X570 motherboard chipset for full PCIe 4.0.  The only one fanless is the $700 Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme (without enough SATA).  My impression is the fans tend to be pretty quiet.
The third cheapest is this Asus. I like Asus, this board has everything I want, and is highly reviewed.  The two cheaper ones are ASRock, I'd rather go with Asus.

And I like it.  
It's the same brand as my last two cases (Sonata Elite and P180).

I really like the three big + slow = quiet intake fans. I might replace them with PWM's.
The positive pressure / intake fans makes a lot more sense to me than the negative pressure / exhaust fans on my old case, which sucked unfiltered air through the power supply with its fan shut down most of the time.  It fits a 450mm graphics card, while reducing 3.5" drive bays to six.  I don't think it's worth having to clean a separate power supply intake, like this.

Build is estimated at 499 watts. These power supplies don't even spin up their fan till 40% usage, so more capacity = more quiet. It comes with 10 SATA connectors, so it should be good on connectors. Huh, pcpartpicker doesn't check that. 
It has one 12 volt rail, which means I don't need to worry about power distribution.  Fully modular.

<p>My hard drives are logging more SMART errors than I'd like.  I currently have three 2tb disk drives, and one 500gb drive.  I replaced them with four 3TB WD Red drives (WD30EFRX) in a zfs pool, for $109 each.  And a 500gb Samsung SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM) for $159.  These are among the most popular drives currently, <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/WD_Red">silentpcreview.com says good things about WD Red</a>, and I like the look of the Samsung SSDs (minimal).</p>

point.  3840 X 2160, and I sit very far back on my couch, so I'm not
concerned about the pixel density.  Make sure it can do 4k at
<b>real</b> 60hz+.  (Some advertise it, or higher, but don't have the
input bandwidth due to HDMI limitiations.  Some are advertized as "4K
Ultra HD 120Hz" but can only do, for example, 30hz at 4k.)  Probably
need to wait for HDMI 2.0 to be able to drive 4k over 30hz, although
displayport 1.2 can handle at least 4096x2160 at 60hz.  I'd like to get
something I could get a floor stand for (rotating would be nice).  Seiki and TCL appear to be the
two brands of 4k TVs under $1000 now (under 60hz at 4k), and reviews are kind of impressively terrible.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/20i087/best_1080p_vs_dk1_comparison_of_screen_door/cg3z3ts">Reddit suggestion.</a>  <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_uhd4k_gpus&amp;num=1">Phoronix on 4k.</a>
</p>

<p>
Apparently also need to make sure the monitor supports <a href="https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/777438/geforce-900-series/gtx-980-and-samsung-4k-tv-hu8550-60hz-works-but-not-getting-4-4-4-full-rgb-output/">4:4:4 (full RGB) at 3840x2160@60Hz</a>.  And input lag.  How is color accuracy (IPS panels are better than TN panels)?

<p>
For years I used Nvidia cards because they at least had decent proprietary drivers.  Now AMD/ATI provides good open source drivers, so I'm switching to them.  I'm playing with <a href="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/">wayland</a> a lot, so the bugginess of the Nvidia open source drivers is often painful, and wayland doesn't work at all with any proprietary drivers.  I compared all the top performers on <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/2012-vga-gpgpu/benchmarks,135.html">Tom's Hardware's video charts</a> until I found prices I could tolerate, then went looking for one that was quieter than most, hence the IceQ.  Verified it works with the linux open source drivers by checking "man radeon".

<b>Intel vs. AMD CPU?</b><br />
I like AMD, I like their Athlons, the Athlon 64's seem like a good idea. I am particularly interested in their Quiet 'n' Cool feature (and a motherboard that supports it). Also, AMD has been kicking Intel's ass.<br />
<br />
<b>Nvidia vs. ATI graphics?</b><br />
I prefer Nvidia over ATI for numerous reasons including Linux support. I want SLI support because I think there is a reasonable possibility it will be a useful upgrade path, which basically means I want a nforce4 sli northbridge. And similar to Intel vs. AMD, Nvidia has been consistantly ahead of ATI.<br />
Update 2010-11: I don't think anyone ever actually uses SLI (nVidia) or Crossfire (AMD/ATI) as an upgrade path.
<br />
<br />
<b>Which Nvidia?</b><br />
I don't want to spend the money on a nvidia's top of the line 7800gtx nvidia card, and the performance of the 7800gt is decent, although still expensive.<br />
<br />
<b>Which motherboard and graphics card manufacturer?</b><br />
I have been very fond of Asus motherboards forever. I think getting a motherboard and video card with matching manufacturers and chip manufacturers makes sense, hence getting asus motherboard and video card both with nvidia chips. This means an Asus A8N-SLI motherboard. The standard doesn't support Quiet 'n' Cool. For that I have to spend $41 more for the A8N-SLI Premium or wait for the currently unavailable A8N-SLI SE. The northbridge heatpipe on the Premium is sexy.<br />
"The Premium is an updated version of the deluxe with alot more upgrades and errors fixed." - <a href="http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/46615/">a8n-sli premium faq</a><br />
Socket 939 is the latest, most future proof, and what all the stuff I like uses.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM?</b><br />
A lot of people have had problems with less than great ram (with asus nforce4 motherboards), and the Corsair Twinx2048-3200c2pt is most highly recommended. I'd prefer <a href="http://www.nvnews.net/reviews/evga_6600gt_sli/images/mushkin.jpg">mushkin purple</a>, but haven't found it (it has occurred in <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=6127">purple in "2 x 512MB of Mushkin Level II Dual Pack PC3200 RAM @ 2-3-3-6")</a><br />

<br />
<b>Graphics cooling?</b><br />
Current Geforce video cards are known to be noisy. The Arctic Cooling NV Silencer 5 REV 3 is highly recommended because it reduces the gpu temperature significantly, is a lot quieter, and vents directly out of the case.<br />
<br />
<b>Case &amp; CPU heatsink?</b><br />
The Antec P180 case seems to be the quietest case that isn't over $1k (zalman), and it's handling of thermal issues seems well thought out. I figure all the fans I'll use will be 1 or 2 of the top case fans (on low) and the video card fan. The power supply will cool the hard drives. The case fans will only have the cpu left to cool, and I figure some ducting around the massive ninja heatsink should drop the temp some and be fine with no cpu fan (I've seen confirmation). All rear vent holes (around the PS and video card) will be sealed with hvac tape.<br />
What's this about <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=27846">"reports of slight case issues (the warping/bent doors)"</a>?<br />
<br />
<b>Power extension cord</b><br />
This combination of case and MB tends to have problems with the 4-pin power cord reaching, so I'll get an extension cord (and should di-electric grease it).<br />
<br />
<b>Floppy</b><br />
The faq recommends upgrading the MB bios via a boot floppy first, so I'll get a floppy drive.<br />
<br />
<b>Which AMD CPU?</b><br />
The Athlon 64 part is obvious. The 3200 winchester ($190) seems to fall in a nice place on a price per performance graph, but with everything else top of the line that would be my bottleneck, so I should probably go higher. bored2sleep has recommended the x2 3800+, which is $322. At the moment I want the 3800+ venice because it's 116% as fast as the x2 3800+ for single threaded apps, and cheaper.<br />
"spend the extra 20 bucks and get the dual core 3800+, the performance difference is wonderful (you'll really notice it even with small things like playing music while surfing the net). While the single core one is faster in sheer benchmarks and games, you'll notice the dual core's benefits more (its perceptively faster)" - <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?p=232338">teknerd</a>, so I'm back to the x2.<br />
According to <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/11/21/the_mother_of_all_cpu_charts_2005/page39.html">Tom's Hardware's most excellent charts, there are 4 socket 939 CPUs faster than the 3800 Venice</a> (the rest are Socket 754 or Intel). Here are their newegg prices, and speed as a percentage of the 3800+ Venice using winrar:

As you can see, the 4000+ San Diego is the only one even slightly possibly worth spending more of my money on.<br />
While I don't intend to overclock, <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/amd64-4000/">NeoSeeker's article on the 4000+ San Diego</a> has me comfortable going with the 3800+ due to its headroom.<br />
teknerd on <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=27923">SPCR</a> has convinced me that a x2 3800+ would be noticeably better than a 3800+ Venice, so I'm going with it. Also, it seems like games are not likely to be CPU bound on an x2 3800+ until after the dual cores are better supported. (<a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/cpu-games2_4.html">article about games not being cpu bound, and Doom 4 and Serious Sam 2 support dual cores</a>)<br />

<b>Hard drive?</b><br />
I was going to get a western digital WD3200KS 320gb SATA2 drive until a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/12/21/samsung_adds_capacity_to_fast_and_quiet_t133_series/page3.html">tom's hardware article pointed out to me that SATA2 drives aren't faster than UATA100</a>. So instead I'll get the SATA1 twin to my Western Digital WD2500JB 250GB UATA100 drive and raid1 / stripe them. 500gb, with performance that should kill any single drive available. And $99 instead of $156. But will they be too noisy?<br />
The nforce4 northbridge comes with raid 0/1/0+1.<br />
I've had enough people discourage me from doing RAID1 due to concern for instability of the raid controller (although I don't think specifically with this northbridge). So I'll at least hold off on the second drive for a bit. (thanks to Talorc on <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=27923">SPCR</a>)<br />

<b>Power supply?</b><br />
I would prefer to have a <a href="http://www.antec.com/">Antec NeoHE 430</a>, but I already have the (noisier) PC Power &amp; Cooling Silent 360, and <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/article265-page1.html">SilentPCReview</a>'s article states that "all of our test systems could easily be handled by a 300W power supply that conforms to ATX12V v2.xx." The 7800GT does not draw significantly more than the tested 6800GT, and the PCP&amp;C silent 360 puts out as many 12v amps as the well liked and ATX12V v2.0 compliant Seasonic S12-330. This would leave the PCP&amp;C as the least worthy component of the system, but I don't think that alone justifies an upgrade - I don't think the noise level will bother me.<br />
I know about the problems with the NeoHE and would be willing to RMA it if I got one that didn't work.<br />

<b>Thermal Compound</b><br />
Arctic Silver 5 has been the choice of thermal compound for attaching heatsinks for years. I was thinking about just using the goop that comes with the vga cooler and heatsink I'm getting, but I've read of several people regretting they didn't pick up the AS5 for the same equipment.<br />
"i put arctic silver on my htpc cpu and it went from 150[F] down to 94[F]" - bitbyte, #htpc, efnet, 12/29/05<br />
I believe my athlon 1400 cooked itself to death due to the stock thermal tape drying out over 4 years. I plan to reapply thermal goop every 2 years.<br />
<br />
<b>Case Fan</b><br />
I successfully set the machine up with the only fans being the NV Silencer on the video card and a single (the smallest) stock 120mm case fan in the back, ducted over the CPU heatsink (with no fan of its own). But I was <i>very</i> disapointed that the stock fans can only be powered by molex connectors, not standard motherboard connectors. So I picked up the Nexus 120mm, hooked it to my motherboard, enabled Q-Fan2 (dynamic fan speed control based on CPU temperature, an Asus motherboard feature) and Quiet 'n Cool (dynamic underclocking based on load, an Athlon 64 feature supported by my motherboard).
<hr />
<h2>Poorly organized notes</h2>
I want a motherboard without a northbridge fan, but I believe that can be nicely achieved with a <a href="http://www.zalman.co.kr/usa/product/view.asp?idx=71&amp;code=014">zalman northbridge heatsink</a> on any mb with a fan, but I have a feeling it won't fit with an AC VGA silencer on a A8N-SLI based on some <a href="http://www.pcdvd.com.tw/showthread.php?t=461684">pictures</a>. But not voiding a motherboard's warranty is nice.<br />
<br />
The $379 eVGA SLI motherboard and Geforce 7800GT combo is an interesting cheaper possibility. The mb is apparently a rebadged <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2506">jetaway which has gotten extremely impressive reviews</a>. It has a far more elegant method of switching between a single video card and SLI than anything else - 3 dedicated slots. Use the middle one for 1 card, and the outside 2 for SLI. This apparently improves overclocking potential as well. This will be copied by everyone. But it doesn't support Quiet 'n' Cool.<br />
<br />
http://www.overclockers.co.uk/acatalog/ASUS_Socket_939.html and http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=311465 claim to have the A8N-SLI SE in stock.<br />

<blockquote>
<div>Problem with Dual Core processors, is their price exceeds their value.<br />
<br />
Take the Athlon X2 3800+ for example, the "budget dual core", running at 2.0 GHz/512 kB makes this basically, two Athlon 64 3200+. For single threaded applications you'll see only minor performance improvements over the 3200+, and even in highly optimized conditions, you may see only 50% boost.<br />
<br />
For the same money you could get, what, an Athlon 64 4000+? Although with the Dual Core, you get a better multitasking experience, and it makes up for many of the architectural weaknesses of the Athlon 64 architecture, when push comes to shove, the faster single core will consistently bring home the bacon.<br />

<blockquote>
<div>The 3500 is simply a higher clocked 3000 or 3200. Therefore, it is not significantly faster than the 3200.<br />
<br />
The 3700 has 1M of L2 cache, as opposed to the 3000, 3200, or 3500, which have 512K. Therefore, you will see a significant performance increase going that route. The 3500 is $20 less than a 3700. So go 3200, or 3700.<br />

Works great in SLI with my N515 and the motherboard it came with. Had to upgrade my PSU." - Joebot on newegg, 12/23/05<br />
"The difference between this model (N518) and other models such as N515-N517 is the BIOS versions. If you look up community support at EVGA.com there are many people having issues with previous models. Artifacting, heat issues, clock issues, using older drivers to be stable, etc., and require GPU BIOS flashing which is provided by EVGA engineers. Not sure if that voids warranty or not if flash goes wrong. Also seems like the BIOS update flashing aren't 100% guranteed to fix the technical issues owners are having as many of them note. I'd play it safe and spend a little more on this model with latest BIOS or other brand models. Probably the reason why there's a gap in the pricing of the same videocard." - n/a on newegg, 12/2/05<br />
