<h1>Boot Lacing</h1>
By Darxus@ChaosReigns.com, Mon Jul 19 22:58:21 EDT 1999
<p>This document attempts to depict some neat ways of lacing boots. Ladder
lacing (#1) is pretty common. #2 is something I came up w/ today. #3 is a
combination of #1 &amp; #2 I haven't tried, but I thought would be fun to
demonstrate combinations.</p>
<p>These layouts are specifically for boots w/ 8 pairs of holes. The patterns
can easily be extrapolated to whatever you want.</p>
<p>1st row is at the toe<br />
last row is at the top of the boot<br />
outside = what you actually see<br />
inside = what you'd see if you were in the boot</p>

<p>Yes, I was bored.</p>
<p>I'd show you how I tie my shoes too, but I think that'd be a bit much in
ascii :)</p>

<p>i was looking at your site and thought i'd share with you the way i lace my
boots. My boots stay tight and feel good (well to me they do.) I just square
knot at the top and tuck the rest into the boot.</p>

the one side is just looped straight out the end, while the other side of the
lace does all the work... ofcourse the diagonals would go the other way on the
other shoe.
<p>i've included a helpful reference image :)</p>

<p>notice the nice italian leather used in sneakers.. even italian nikes use
this look and material.</p>
<p>i think mine may have come this way - maybe not.. i still think my shoes are
laced cooler.</p>

<p>the other end of the (inner) lace connects a to b, running visible the whole
way up.</p>
