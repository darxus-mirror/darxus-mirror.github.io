    <h1>dlkern, the linux kernel downloader</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="dl/dlkern">Download Current Version.</a></li>

      <li><a href="dl/">Download older version.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="output.txt">Example output patching from linux-2.6.12.5 to
      linux-2.6.14.2</a> (11/23/05, v57)<br />
      In this example, the total file sizes of the necessary patches is only
      23% of the full linux-2.6.14.2 tarball.</li>

      <li><a href="output.html">Typical output</a> (v31)</li>
    </ul>dlkern is better than manual downloading because:

    <ul>
      <li>Automated upgrading via patches (-p flag) significantly reduces
      download time for you and load on the kernel servers.</li>

      <li>Specifying your country code (-c flag) distributes load on kernel
      servers more efficiently.</li>

      <li>Cryptographic signature verification reduces the chances of you
      running a maliciously modified kernel.</li>
    </ul>Features:

    <ul>
      <li>Determines current versions and URLs of stable, beta, and prepatch
      versions of the linux kernel via finger @ftp.kernel.org.</li>

      <li>Downloads via ncftpget or wget.</li>

      <li>Automatic download and verification of kernel signatures.</li>

      <li>Allows specification of 2 letter country code for <a href=
      "http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">the kernel mirror system</a>.</li>

      <li>Allows selection of .gz or .bz2 compression.</li>
    </ul><br />
    This program was mentioned in the February 2001 issue of <a href=
    "http://www.linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a> (issue 82) - a print
    magazine.

    <h2>But WHY?</h2>When I started writing this in 1999, you couldn't just go
    to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</a> and click a
    kernel version and immediately start downloading a tarball (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990125100558/http://www.kernel.org/">1999 archive</a>). I like to think
    that the effort I put into writing dlkern caused someone to realise the
    need for the work that resulted in the very helpful links they have there
    today.<br />
    <br />
    Back then you had to ftp in, and burrow through the archive directory
    structure. I do believe I got lost a few times. But most of all it was
    tedious. I hate tedious.<br />
    <br />
    So I wrote dlkern as a simple script to do my downloading for me. And then
    it just kept getting more and more robust until it was actually recommended
    in a real print magazine.<br />
    <br />
    Then I abandoned it for 4 years. Then when I dusted it off, much to my
    amazement, it still worked. Then I added the patch downloading
    ability.<br />
    <br />
    Perhaps some day soon you will be able to run dlkern nightly from cron to
    keep your kernel source tree up to date with no interaction required from
    you.
