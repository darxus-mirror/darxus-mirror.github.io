    <p>(5/12/02) <b><a href="3d.html">Can now
    generate 3D graphs !</a></b></p>

    <p>Springgraph will read in a <a href=
    "input.html">.dot file description of a
    graph</a>, which, for each node, specifies
    its name and which other nodes it is
    connected to, and then renders a graph. Each
    node is drawn as an ellipse, and each
    connection is drawn as an arrow. The node
    placement is a result of all of the nodes
    moving away from each other, while all nodes
    which are connected move toward each other.
    This movement is repeated until it
    stabilizes.</p>

    <p>Springgraph was written as an alternative
    to neato, which is part of <a href=
    "http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">
    graphviz</a>. It attempts to read the same
    .dot files used by graphviz, but currently
    only supports a limited number of node
    attributes (label and fillcolor). I am open
    to requests for support for more
    graph/node/edge attributes. I have used neato
    quite a lot since September of 2000, when I
    started writing programs to convert <a href=
    "../apache2dot/index.html">apache log files</a>,
    <a href="../sig2dot/index.html">gpg/pgp keyring
    signature relationships</a>, and <a href=
    "../cinclude2dot/index.html">C include
    relationships</a> to .dot files to be graphed
    with neato. <a href="3d.html"><img src="dl/phillylinux_full_white.png" alt="plug 3d"
    width="346" height=
    "260" /></a></p>

    <p><a href="compare.html">Compare springgraph
    and neato output.</a></p>

    <p>Reasons I wanted an alternative to
    neato:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>More appropriate math for what I graph,
      resulting in better graph layouts: neato
      uses line lengths - every node tries to be
      a certain distance from every other node it
      is connected to. To increase the size of
      the graph (and eliminate node overlaps),
      you must increase the default line length.
      So in large graphs, all nodes try to be
      some large distance from every other node.
      In springgraph, every node tries to be as
      close as possible to every node it is
      connected to, while pushing away from every
      node. I think this method is better suited
      to the kinds of graphs I tend to generate,
      like those of keyrings.</li>

      <li>neato is released under an (opensource)
      license that is incompatible with the
      <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
      springgraph is released under the GPL.</li>

      <li>In the process of figuring out how to
      write springgraph, I <b>DID</b>, as I had
      hoped, learn how to <a href=
      "3d.html">output a graph in 3D</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <p>Usage:</p>

    <p><tt>cat test.dot | ./springgraph.pl -s 3
    &gt; springgraph.png</tt></p>

    <p>The "<tt>-s 3</tt>" specifies the scale,
    and is optional. All of the node locations
    are multiplied by this. Increase the scale to
    eliminate node overlaps. Decrease the scale
    to make the graph smaller.</p>
    <hr />
    <a href="input.html">Definition of the input
    (.dot) files that springgraph renders</a>

    <p>The following programs generate .dot files
    that are fully supported by springgraph:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "../sig2dot/index.html">sig2dot</a></li>

      <li><a href=
      "../cinclude2dot/index.html">cinclude2dot</a></li>

      <li><a href=

      depency tree in dot-format based upon
      c-files.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    Thiseveing (5/9/02) it occurred to me why
    neato is the way it is - why its method is
    sometimes more appropriate than the one I use
    in springgraph. This happened as I was
    testing springgraph with some of the graphviz
    example files, and noticed that in <a href=
    "http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/examples/undirected/process.html">
    this graph</a>, all of the lines
    <i>should</i> be the same length, as they are
    drawn by neato, not adjusted according to the
    positioning of other nodes, <a href=
    "dl/process.png">as they are drawn by
    springgraph</a>.
