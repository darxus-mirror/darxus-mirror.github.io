Subject: [fm #11093] (news-admins) Submission report - Pretty CoLoRs

The following notes are in response to your recent freshmeat.net submission:

- freshmeat tries to avoid listing projects which fall
below a certain level of size and/or complexity (please see
http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/198/ for more information), and
yours is unfortunately a bit too simple for our application index. Your
contribution has been respectfully declined.  You might try submitting
it to http://www.freecode.com/ instead.


Sincerely,
Steve Killen
