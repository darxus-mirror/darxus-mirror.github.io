<h1>Pretty CoLoRs for UNIX</h1>
</div>
I once had someone tell me they disliked Unix because it was too black-and-white for their tastes. So I created <a href="pclr.html">pclr (click here to download)</a> (Pretty CoLoRs), a perl script through which you can run any command line program, that will randomize the color of every character as it is being printed. Then <a href="http://www.billjonas.com">Bill Jonas</a> rewrote <a href="pclr.c">pclr in C</a>.
<p>Obviously, the person who felt that Unix was not colorful enough had little experience with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>They had only used the command line and were not aware of Unix's GUI, <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>, which can be very pretty if you use a window manager like <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/shots.html">enlightenment</a>.</li>
<li>They were unaware of the many <a href="index.html#colorize">applications that can be made colorful</a>.</li>
</ol>
On this page I intend to document <a href="index.html#colorize">ways to make the Unix command line more colorful</a>.
<p><a id="pclr"></a> If you were to use <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a> to look at <a href="../../index.html">my home page</a> from the command line through <a href="pclr.html">pclr (click here to download)</a> (<tt>lynx http://www.chaosreigns.com | pclr</tt>), it might look like this:<br />
<img src="pclr01.png" width="579" height="340" alt="[lynx+pclr screenshot]" /><br />
I have tested <a href="pclr.html">pclr</a> with many command line applications, and have not found problems with any. Of course, if you find any problems running any console application through <a href="pclr.html">pclr</a>, <a href="mailto:Darxus@ChaosReigns.com">let me know</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat.net</a> has rejected my submission of pclr. This, as you may know, is the main forum through which to publicize the existence of a new open-source application. I encourage you to read their <a href="rejection.txt">rejection notice</a>, and <a href="mailto:news-admins@freshmeat.net?subject=Re%58%20[fm%20#11093]%20(news-admins)%20Submission%20report%20-%20Pretty%20CoLoRs">complain</a>.</p>
