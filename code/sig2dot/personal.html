<h2>Your own personal Web of Trust graph</h2>
<a href="trustgraph.sh">trustgraph.sh</a>
<p>Running this script with your email address as an argument will create a
graph of your key and all the keys that have signed your key. It requires that
gpg, sig2dot.pl, and neato (part of graphviz) be in your path, and that you
have a keyserver set in your ~/.gnupg/options file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
$ ls
$./trustgraph.sh darxus@chaosreigns.com
$ ls 
darxus@chaosreigns.com.gpg
darxus@chaosreigns.com.ids
darxus@chaosreigns.com.ps
stats.html 
</pre>
As you can see, it created 4 files.
<p>darxus@chaosreigns.com.gpg is a keyring file containing my key and all those
which have signed my key.<br />
darxus@chaosreigns.com.ids is a list of the key IDs of my key and all those who
have signed it.<br />
darxus@chaosreigns.com.ps is a graph of the signature relationships between my
key and all those who have signed it.<br />
stats.html is a graph if signature counts (only counting signatures from within
this keyring file).</p>
<p>I recommend viewing the postscript (.ps) graph with <a href=
"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gv/">gv</a>, but you can also convert it to a
jpeg using convert, which is part of <a href=
"http://www.imagemagick.org/">imagemagick</a> like this:</p>
<p><kbd>convert darxus@chaosreigns.com.ps darxus@chaosreigns.com.jpg</kbd></p>
<p>The postscript file is much better detail and smaller than the jpeg.</p>
