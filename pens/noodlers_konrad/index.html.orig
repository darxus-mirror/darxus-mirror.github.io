<h1>Noodler's Konrad, acrylic</h1>

<p>I have so many feelings about this pen.  It's $22.54 shipped.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<ul>
<li>I really appreciate them making flex pens available so inexpensively.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/240492-noodlers-ahab-ease-my-flex-mod/">Ease My Flex mod</a> can apparently make it much more flexible.</li>
<li>I love the cap over the piston knob, and don't understand why this is uncommon.</li>
<li>A replacement flex nib costs $7.54 shipped.</li>
<li>Ebonite feed - can be heat set, which is awesome, unlike plastic.</li>
<li>Piston filling is nice.</li>
<li>Clip can easily be removed if you don't want it.</li>
<li>The grip is a nice shape.</li>
<li>Made to be fiddled with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bad:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/4bslox/noodlers_konrad_no_longer_work_with_6_nibs/">New versions don't fit #6 nibs.</a>  I'm very surprised by this, since the maker seems so enthusiastic about interchangeability.</li>
<li>Un-removable inner cap wicks up ink.  Soaking overnight, or squirting a lot with a blunt syringe, have not helped at all alone.  Together they work, but take a while.  (My pen is clear, so that's ugly.)</li>
<li>The inside of the clip is made up of claws, which caused several pulls in the pocket of my jeans it was clipped too.  I fixed it with a hammer.</li>
<li>Nib clicked one out of three times I tried to flex it, until I re-seated it several times, has been fine since.</li>
<li>The clip (where it's bent) gouged the paint on one of my Pilot Metropolitans clipped in my jeans next to it.</li>
<li>The pen has been a bit messy, I suspect caused by a gap between the nib and feed, which may be fixable with heat setting.</li>
<li>Needs to be fiddled with.</li>
</ul>
