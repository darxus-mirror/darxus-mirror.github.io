<h1>Pilot Metropolitan</h1>

<p>These are the first two fountain pens I bought.  The fit and finish is excellent, the nibs feel great, the barrel and cap is painted brass, they just work, and they're inexpensive.  I highly recommend them.
</p>

<p>Really, they're just so well thought out it's hard to think of much to say about them.  But I do have a few things I object to.</p>

<p>
I don't like how tapered the grip / section is, and I don't like how slippery it is.  I hold it at the thickest part, and this combination results in my fingers slipping down, which has resulted in me habitually wiping my fingers off whenever trying to write anything.  I thought maybe the narrow end would be good for some people, but when I think of the wider pens used by children and arthritic people, that seems unlikely.  I'm tempted to try texturizing it.
</p>

<p>Similarly, I wish they used more standard cartridges, but I think their cartridges are better than international cartridges.  The wider opening fits more securely, wobbles less, and I've had great success re-sealing them with their original stoppers.
</p>

<p>I kind of wish the nibs were a standard type (#5 or #6), but really, their system is very nice.  Very well made, and the nibs are interchangeable with the 1mm italic in the Pilot Plumix ($6), and the extra fine in the Pilot Penmanship.
</p>

<p>I started with the fine, then got the medium after realizing that would show shading better (variations in darkness that are a characteristic of some inks).
</p>

<p>I got these, in plain black, for about $15 shipped, each.
