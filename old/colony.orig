<h1>Computerist Colonies</h1>
<p>BTW: I still don't quite like this name, so feel free to <a href="mailto:Darxus@ChaosReigns.com">give me suggestions</a>.

<p>

This has been a dream of mine for quite some time, and I figured that there were others out there with similar interests. 
This has been confirmed as a result of discussion on the <a href="http://www.hope.net">Beyond HOPE</a> mailing list.  So I've
decided to do what I can to spread the idea.


<p>

The mailing list is up!  I put up a mailing list for all those with any interest in this concept, to promote its growth.  It
is colony@idle.com -- to subscribe, email <a href="mailto:colony-request@idle.com">colony-request@idle.com</a> with the word
"subscribe" (no quotes) in the message body, with no topic.  <br>And feel free to stop by the #colony IRC channel (EFNet)...

<p>

Ever heard of Artist Colonies ?  -- A bunch of art fanatics going out in the middle of a desert or something to be in solitude
amongst their own kind, and build a place to live, to allow more inspiration and less disturbance from the outside world. 
Well, I have no intentions of building a home in a desert (hard to get t1's out there I would think).  Anyplace with people
with excessive interest and ability with computers, and available high-speed Internet connections is fine with me.

<p>

People who excel at something (like art, or computers (which could also be considered an art)), excel even more amongst others
like themselves (appreciation and understanding are wonderful things).  And when they work together in such environments, what
we can accomplish is absolutely mind blowing.  (the hardware-pooling part of the computer version is nice too) 

<p>

So my goal is to encourage the development of hundreds of thriving, interacting, Computerist Colonies.  Probably all of them
starting out small (around five people), but my dreams are <i>much</i> more grandiose... on the scale of hundreds -- but I
know <i>I</i> am a long way off from being able to handle the logistics of a permanent gathering on that scale. 

<p>

This is one of those fundamentally good ideas that will happen weither you or I am involved.  The question is, do we
encourage and help shape it, or do we let it run without us ?
<br>It should be obvious what <i>my</i> answer is.

<p>

The biggest problem with this concept is that everyone who wants to be involved can't just quit their jobs and go move in to
one of these situations, because it will take a while for a company formed in this manner to be able to break even
financially. So, to begin with, everyone would need to have a stable job in the area in which the colony is being formed.

I'm in the process of attempting to contact these people -- having problems connecting to their site to get an email address.

<b>New York City, New York, USA</b>
<p>notwork

The people who did <a href="http://www.hope.net">Beyond HOPE</a> (from my understanding) have a thing called notwork, which is
similar to what we're trying to do.  They have about 10 people in New York City.  I will make more information available about
them once/if I get their approval.  I should know their url, it's pretty intuitive, but I'm not online at the moment, so I
can't check (it's probably www.notwork.net or something)

<p>

from email:

<br>Darxus, I am also interested creating a computerist colony. My group, which is a younger group, and becoming financially
independent is difficult.  We currently have irregular scheduled, yet often meetings, and instead of LAN networks we've
integrated BBS that were on our separate servers.  The groups name is the Oakmont Asylum, for less than obvious reasons. 
We're from different backgrounds, and I think the term "Computerist" is well suited on the whole. Within 5-8yrs, yeah, that's
always away, but that's when the asylum will be planning to make the move to Boston, or Greater Boston. We are no a group of
[evil <a href="tla.html">TLA</a>]-hack lamers, and currently are working on our own Web design/Pub business. I'd appreciate a
response to "shea6@juno.com".

<b>Lansdale (Eastern) Pennsylvania, USA</b> 
<br>(me and my friends)

<p>

I have a number of friends, who, like me, are avid computer fanatics, and we have formed a computer consulting/web
design/software development company (there are about 5 of us).  We intend to rent an apartment and move in together in the
very near future, hook up all our computers in a LAN, and put up a permanent gateway to the Internet (probably dial-up for
now, t1 when we get the money -- at which point we'd also become an ISP).  This is in the Lansdale area -- Eastern
Pennsylvania, USA.  We want to keep it small to start with, but if you're in the area and interested, contact me (<a
href="mailto:Darxus@ChaosReigns.com">Darxus@ChaosReigns.com</a>).

<b>Cleveland Ohio, USA</b>
<br>Contact: michael stutz - <a href="mailto:stutz@dsl.org">stutz@dsl.org</a>
<br>URL: <a href="http://dsl.org/m/">http://dsl.org/m/</a>
<p>

michael stutz is interested in a similar thing for the Cleveland (216) area, or elsewhere if he moves. he's interested in both
the arts and sciences and sees a natural connection between hacking and literature, art and computing, and is interested in
the innovation that can come from collaborative groups in this area. 

<p>

<b>Norway, Europe</b>
<br>Contact Kristian Faye Solstad - <a href="mailto:Computer.Heaven@riksnett.no">Computer.Heaven@riksnett.no</a>
<p>

This guy in Europe is very interested in doing the same thing. 

<p><hr><p>

If you have/know of a 24/7 / live-in LAN party / computer consulting/web design/software development/ISP company / Computerist
Colony, or are anywhere <i>near</i> as interested in the concept as I am, subscribe to the above mentioned mailing list, <a
href="mailto:Darxus@ChaosReigns.com">drop me a line</a>, or both. 

<p>

<b>A brief note on the word "computerist":</b> 

<br>People who do art are called artists, and I've wanted a word to accurately described me for some time.  I do computers,
and the term "Computer Professional" sounds much more like a guy who lives in a three piece suit.  I look great in a suit, but
I live in jeans.  I think my preferred business outfit would be Timberland boots, blue-jeans, one of those nice white button
up shirts with the button down collar, and a tie.  (And I'm eagerly awaiting the day when my hair is long enough to be tied
back)

<br>"Computerist" seems about right to me. 

<p>

I am happy to say that neither any microsoft product, nor any "html editor" have ever touched this document.  It has been
maintained entirely under UNIX, by hand. 

<p>

This page is also <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a> friendly.

<p>

Divided, we are merely a nuisance. 
<br>United, we can undoubtedly be one hell of a force to be reckoned with.  We were born to rule technology.
