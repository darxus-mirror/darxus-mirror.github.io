<b>Good stuff and bad stuff</b>
<dt><i>I like to have lots of my *own* choices to make.  I will not be happy with this situation until all software runs on all operating systems, and all operating systems run on all hardware.</i>
<p>

Good things:
<DT><A HREF="http://fvkma.tu-graz.ac.at/tbm/OpenStep/">OpenStep and other related information</A>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.ecf.toronto.edu:80/plan9/">Plan 9 from Bell Labs</A>
<p>

Bad things:
<p>

I used to have a few links to some anti-Microsoft web pages here, but they were, at best, silly.  I used to just dislike
Windows and how widespread it had become.  I just watched a biograph on Bill Gates.  I don't like Bill Gates.  The biggest
problem with Bill Gates is that it is difficult for people to realize what he is.  If the Founders of the United States of
America were the good guys, Bill Gates is one of the bad guys. 
<p>

Unfortunately, Netscape seems to be going in this direction.  I <i>refuse</i> to use the mail or news stuff in Netscape v2. 
They are taking advantage of a good thing to attempt to take over everything good.  Not cool.  I don't like that Netscape does
its own HTML extensions, and then just expects everybody else to follow them, instead of working with the people that are
writing up the new HTML specifications. 
<p>

I would very much like you to read this <a

what's wrong with Netscape and others</a> (but be sure to come right back 
here)
