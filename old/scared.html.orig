<p>It's a shame how easily people get scared.</p>
<p>I just got fired today from my (new) job because I pulled one of
the cover panels off a computer to look inside.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe that's oversimplifying it a bit. This is what I
did:</p>
<p>1) Apparrently computers of this type <i>can</i> (but weren't)
be configured to shut down automatically if opened (would have been
nice if someone told me this) -- and the fact that I'd opened it
(which started the whole thing) was discovered because one of the 4
corners of the panel wasn't reseated properly when I put it
back.<br />
I think it was that same night that me and another co-worker were
trying to open what is referred to as the "disk farm"
(mother-of-all-RAIDs type deal) -- it didn't happen.... but we had
no impression that it would cause <i>any</i> problems, or it
wouldn't have been done.</p>
<p>2) There's a proxy server that everybody uses to access the Web,
and there's 1 login name and password that everybody uses to get
through the proxy. I checked the IP address of the proxy in the
netscape configuration file, and telnetted through it to my unix
shell account to read my mail, and while I was there I also stopped
in irc. (I've still seen nothing to indicate this is against
policy).</p>
<p>3) I have a personal web page that could possibly offend higher
management.</p>
<p>Isn't it a lovely world we live in ?</p>

Almost 3 years later, I am appreciated for my abilities. I've had a
stable carrear as a computer professional for, I'd say, about 2
years, and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's my job to
tear computers apart, logically more often than physically.
<p>The company I worked for that fired me for opening this computer
was comprised of Marie Hartlein, and her husband. I can't remember
her husband's first name, but he's the one that fired me. Their
company existed primarily to staff McNeil Pharmaceutical's computer
room, where I was contracted to work, and where the above incidents
took place. McNeil has apparently since merged, and become <a href=

<p>I maintain my grudge.</p>
