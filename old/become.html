Out here, in Cyberspace, our knowledge and our skills are our essence.  

<p>

We all enter Cyberspace for the first time knowing nothing.  Being nothing.  

<p>

If this fact is not accepted, and a new member of Cyberspace allows himself to believe that his status in the world of the
flesh matters here, then he will remain lame here until he realizes his error.

<p>

If, however, he accepts that he knows and is nothing, and that the Elders have much to teach, and shows great respect to the
Elders, and a great interest and capacity to learn, then he has begun the journey.

<p>

Learning takes time.  To become a hacker takes an insatiable curiosity.  A desire to learn more, not because of competition,
or any such base reason, but simply because the knowledge can be attained, and you <i>want</i> it.
