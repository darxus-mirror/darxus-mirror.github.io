<br>WHEN I AM DONE WORKING AN EIGHT HOUR DAY
<br>I WANT TO RELAX IN A SICK SORT OF WAY
<br>I FIND RANDOM PEOPLE ON SERVERS AFAR
<br>I BLOW THEM TO KIBBLES WHILE CHUCKLING "HAR HAR"
<br>I DONT PROMOTE VIOLENCE, FOR NOBODY SHOULD
<br>BUT QUAKE IS FOR KILLING AND KILLING IS GOOD

<a href="qscope.scr">qscope.scr</a> -- my own creation, can also be found on <a 
href="http://www.nuqneH.org/aftershock">Aftershock</a>, gives you the power of a very easy to use 9x scope, in any kind of 
Quake game, including deathmatch.
<br>Just put qscope.scr in your quake\id1 directory, and load quake with "quake -exec qscope.scr" (I use a .bat file).  Read 
qscope.scr for more info.
