Cyberculture has suffered greatly from the insurgence of cluelessness.  It used to be that you actually had to know computers,
and be relatively good to get online.  In those days our culture thrived.  In those days anybody who claimed the title of
"hacker" was known to be lame, because anybody who was worthy of the title didn't need it to be said, it was just known.  (By
the way, we need to return to this policy).  In an attempt to help this situation a bit, I've tried to answer the question 
"<a href="hacker.html">what is a hacker?</a>"

<a href="become.html">how to become a hacker</a>

<p>

Why is it that when people with at least a slight clue get the impression that you do UNIX for fun, they think you're a
hacker?  (BTW:  I don't mind this particular steriotype)
