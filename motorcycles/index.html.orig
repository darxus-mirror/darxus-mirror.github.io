<h1>Why You Should Buy a Motorcycle</h1>
<ul>
<li>They are fun. In comparison, cars are incomprehensibly sluggish. The fun is
generally in their acceleration ability -- when you see a sportbike tearing
away from a red light, that's why. Modern sportbikes will plaster your eyeballs
to the back of your skull with very little effort and damn it's
<i>fun</i>.</li>
<li>Depending on the kind of bike and the displacement of its engine, bikes can
get anywhere from 20mpg (speed-tuned racebikes) to over 100mpg (little 50cc
scooters that top out at 37mph). A ~500cc Universal Japanese Motorcycle will
generally average 50-60mpg. (50cc scooters are legal in the bicycle lane in
Boston).</li>
<li>They are far more convenient to park than cars.</li>
<li>They cost a lot less than cars.</li>
<li>They are far more maneuverable in traffic. I believe it reduces my commute
time by 33%.</li>
<li>Motorcycles are much less likely to hydroplane because of the shape of the
tires.</li>
<li>Rain suits work on motorcycles too - just add your (full face) helmet, and
waterproof gloves and boots.</li>
<li>Motorcycles come with quiet exhausts. The loud ones are illegal.</li>
</ul>
Two of the most commonly recommended first bikes:
<ul>
<li>Suzuki GS500 (<a href="http://www.kbb.com">KBB</a> 2002 retail: $2510)
(preferably the GS500E (no faring) over the GS500F (faring))</li>
<li>Kawasaki Ninja 500 (<a href="http://www.kbb.com">KBB</a> 2002 retail:
$2965) (known as the ex500 before 1995)</li>
</ul>
They both have 500cc two cylinder engines. Larger engines have more power which
can more easily get away from a newbie, and with more cylinders the power comes
on more quickly requiring a more subtle wrist to stay shiny side up. You really
don't want to go over 650ccs or two cylinders for your first bike.
<p>Unfaired bikes (without extra plastic) are better for beginners than fared
bikes (with extra plastic) because the plastic is much easier to damage when
you drop it. Which you will. So buy used, and wear armor.</p>
<p>Do not buy a motorcycle until you have gotten your license. You want to take
the <a href=

class</a> before you touch another motorcycle.</p>
<h2>Armor</h2>
<a href="http://www.aerostich.com/home.php?cat=249">Aerostich Roadcrafter</a> -
this is commonly considered the best armor for commuting. One or two pice
(which can be left zipped together), you're supposed to be able to put it on in
10 seconds, and it's waterproof. And probably the most protective synthetic
armor there is.
<p>Synthetics are more convenient for commuting because they can be worn over
clothes. While racing leathers are more protective, they require you to
completely change. <a id="license"></a></p>
<h2>Getting your License (endorsement)</h2>
To get a license (in Massachusetts, similar elsewhere, contact your DMV):
<ul>
<li>Sign up for a <a href=
"http://nm.msf-usa.org/msf/ridercourses.aspx?pagename=RiderCourse+Info">Motorcycle
Safety Foundation Beginner Rider Course</a> (MSF BRC)</li>
<li>Read the driver's manual online (same for cars and bikes).</li>
<li>Go to the DMV/RMV, take the written test, pass, pay for a permit and give
them the extra $20 or so to pay for your motorcycle endorsement so you don't
have to go back to do that later.</li>
<li>Take the MSF BRC. Pass. Recieve updated license with motorcycle endorsement
in the mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, the MSF BRC is, I believe, 10 hours on a motorcycle, 8 hours in a
classroom. There is no other acceptable way to learn to ride a motorcycle.</p>
<p>I do not recommend touching a bike, other than those owned by the MSF, until
you've gotten your license. You are statistically much more likely to have
accidents any other way (especially being taught by a friend).</p>
<h2>Buy a Motorcycle</h2>
<p>Buy used. You will drop it. It's okay.</p>
<p>Go to <a href=
"http://www.craigslist.com/about/cities.html">craigslist.com</a>, click the
closest city, click "motorcycles" (under "for sale").</p>
<p>Bring someone with you who is familiar with motorcycles to look over
anything you're considering buying.</p>
