<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/In-what-languages-besides-English-are-spelling-and-pronunciation-very-different-and-why">English has some of the most inconsistent spelling.</a>  This makes it much more difficult, and therefore expensive, to teach.  Which is unfortunate for the de facto international language.  It makes communication more difficult for the entire world.  And it's fixable.
</p>

<p>I suggest everyone pick more regular spellings of just a <a href="#ideas">couple words</a> that don't seem too strange to you, and use them.  This way, very gradually, you can help fix the language.
</p>

<p>On this page I basically try to predict how English would naturally become more consistent 
on its own. This idea upsets some people.  "You can't just <i>change</i> English!"  Living languages, languages that are in active use, change.  Would you prefer those changes to be entirely accidental?  Wouldn't it be better if some of those changes were carefully thought out?</p>

<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Auxiliary_languages">Many
constructed languages</a> have been created in hopes of providing a somehow
more useful alternative for international communication.  The main problem is
getting people to actually use them.  English is the de facto international
language, and takes a long time to learn because of how internally inconsistent
it is.  What if we created a language that was as easy to learn as possible, by
being as internally consistent as possible, while also being as easy to read as
possible for people who already know English?  Make adoption easier, and
encourage people to use pieces of it to make their English easier to
understand, as they are comfortable.
Possibly entirely, in places where people are particularly concerned about international accessibility, where things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English">Basic English</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_English">Special English</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English">Simplified English</a> are used.  It might also be useful for fiction which requires a futuristic language.

<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>

<p>
All of the changes I'm suggesting are changes which I believe could happen from natural regularization, given enough time.  I'm not certain of any of these choices, and am interested in suggestions.
</p>

<p>Verb (past tense), noun (plural), and spelling regularization 
happens naturally over time.  For example, the plural of "cow" changed
from "kine" to "cows", the past tense of "help" changed from "holpe"
to "helped", and "plow" changed from "plough".  There are many of these straight forward changes left to do.
</p>

<p>A popular example of spelling inconsistency 
that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti">at
least 140 years old</a>:  If the 'gh' sound in 'enou<b>gh</b>' is
pronounced 'f', and the 'o' in 'w<b>o</b>men' makes the short 'i' sound and
the 'ti' in 'na<b>ti</b>on' is pronounced 'sh' then the word 'ghoti' is
pronounced just like 'fish'.  Those problems can be fixed with these
changes:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>enou<b>gh</b></td><td>enou<b>f</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>w<b>o</b>men</td><td>w<b>i</b>men</td></tr>
<tr><td>na<b>ti</b>on</td><td>na<b>sh</b>on</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Then "fish" is pronounced like "fish".</p>

<p>My thoughts, so far, are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>For every sound (phoneme) pick a single spelling (grapheme), preferably the one easiest to read for people who already read English, avoiding conflicting with other phonemes.  For now, I want to stick to the existing 26 letter alphabet.  (Purely phonetic spelling.)
</li>
<li>Regularize all verbs by adding "-d" (if it ends in 'e') or "-ed" to the present tense to make
the past tense. (My current script always adds -d.)</li>
<li>Regularize all nouns by adding "-s" or "-es" (for words ending in "s" or IPA "ch") to make their plurals.  If the word ends in "y" (IPA "i"), drop the "y" and add "-ees" (equivalent of English "-ies", IPA "iːs").  (My current script always adds "-s".)</li>
<li>Don't change the spellings of the previous two steps for phonetics (spell the end of "cats" and "dogs" the same, even though "dogs" is pronounced like "dogz").</li>
<li>I think it would be good to pick one standard spelling
based on some kind of ideal (most popular?) pronunciation, but
continue to accept regional accents differing from the pronunciation
matching that spelling (apparently exactly how Turkish works, in
practice).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American">General American</a> may be useful.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Similar things have been done.  I think it's important to mention the reason for all the decisions involved, so they can be discussed, and improved on.
</p>

<p>For concrete results, I would like to create a few web browser spell
checking dictionaries for people to use:
</p>
<ol>
<li>One that only adds these more consistent spellings, leaving the old
ones in place, so that people
can choose whichever they wish without their spell checker telling them
it's wrong, and stunting the natural progress of regularization.</li>
<li>One that adds these more consistent spellings, and removes the old
spellings of maybe a dozen ideal candidates, for those who wish to
actively change their habits.</li>
<li>One that contains only these new spellings, for enthusiasts who wish
to play with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was previously using "y" for the short "i" sound, and "i" for the long "i" sound, resulting in "I" -&gt; "I", and "English" -&gt; "Ynglysh".  And the problem of 'y' being used for both a consonant and a vowel, causing "year" to become "yyr".  I changed the short 'y' to 'i', and the long 'i' to 'ai', based on it's IPA /aɪ/, resulting in "I" -&gt; "Ai", and "English" -&gt; "Inglish", and "year" -&gt; "yir".  </p>

<p>I should look at Lojikl Inglish again.

Parsing wiktionary is inconvenient, dealing with stressed vs. unstressed, and senses.  But I've made good progress on it.
</p>

<p>
To do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip slang ({{lb|en|slang|British|Australian}})</li>
<li>Maybe :'s can be completely ignored?</li>
<li>Go over my grapheme to phoneme mapping again.</li>
<li>Deprioritize IPA for senses, instead of dropping it.</li>
<li>Stop dropping any noun / verb forms with apostrophies (contractions)?</li>
<li>Handle templates with double square brackets.</li>
<li>Check for more English words that I'm missing pronunciation for.</li>
<li>Handle heteronym homographs (words spelled the same but pronounced differently), like "minute" = 60 seconds / exceptionally small.</li>
<li>Maybe I should allow all verb / noun forms from the main page of a word, instead of only using the first?</li>
<li>Parse out the IPA to spelling relationships, so I can do things like only regularize the /k/ sounds which are spelled "c"?

<p>I'm pretending "data", "those", and "these" are not plural.  I also haven't handled be/am/is/are,was/were,been.  Ew.  Perhaps one (set of) exception(s) is reasonable.  Be / beed?
</p>

<p>"Myself" gets a hyphen because the author of FEWL doesn't indicate the difference between words that were originally hyphenated, and compounded words.</p>

<p>Words missing from FEWL: states caused bothered converting sounds definitions letters handled emailed noticed apostrophes handling contractions</p>

<p>FEWL is useful because it provides pronunciation, noun plural, and verb past tense info.  But I could get the same stuff by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Help:FAQ#Downloading_Wiktionary">downloading wiktionary</a>.  Which would probably give me more words.</p>

<h2>Be</h2>

<p>Be/am/is/are/was/were/been may be the greatest example of how much of a mess English is.  Seven distinct spellings for what is effectively a single word.  This is exactly why English takes so much longer to learn to read than other languages.  It's also not surprising that this word in particular is so problematic, because research has shown that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2460562/">more commonly used words take longer to naturally become regularized</a>.  This also provides me with a great example to use in detailing how I encourage you to use as much or as little of my spelling methods as you're comfortable with.  This is going to look weird.  Keep in mind that just as it now seems odd that the past tense of "help" was once "holpe" before it was naturally regularized into "helped", if English remains in use long enough, people will one day wonder what madness caused us to use seven apparently random different spellings of the same word.  Also note that I'm not changing the pronunciation of the word "be", just its spelling.

</p>

<hr />

<p>Looking up <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nite">nite</a> made me realize I should scrape wiktionary for more common phonetic spellings of words.
</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of phonetic spelling is that you lose etymology info.  I believe improved ease of international communication is far more valuable.  But I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmXnaX-5d8g">this video</a> is an excellent example of the disadvantages of keeping the spelling that provides etymological clues.  It is a French word.  When it was adopted by English, the French spelling was kept.  As a result, it has been prounced with English phonetics as long as these things have been written down.  It is pronounced "wrong" because when it was adopted, phonetic spelling was not used.
</p>

<p>I haven't handled cases where multiple words are spelled the same but
pronounced different (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_%28linguistics%29#Further_examples">heteronym homographs</a>).  I'd like to spell them differently.  Like "read".
</p>

<p>More extreme possibilities I can think of are a couple cases where
this language could be made more like Lojban, while remaining mutually
intelligible with English:  1) Lojban doesn't have verbs and nouns, it
has primitives which are converted to verbs and nouns by adding
suffixes.  Perhaps this way we could eliminate some redundant words.  2)
Lojban grammar / sentence structure?
("First they came for the verbs, and I said nothing because verbing weirds language. Then they arrival for the nouns, and I speech nothing because I no verbs.")
</p>

<p>What else would make useful improvements?  I think I've read that
poets would love if "you" and "I"/"me" rhymed.
</p>


<p>I should try <a
href="http://www.wyrdplay.org/AlanBeale/keyboard.html">typing with
diacritics</a>, maybe it's
not as bad as I think, and they'd improve the number of phonemes
available without using multiple letters.
</p>

<p>I would strongly support adding new words from other languages, by
mapping them to the provided phonemes.
</p>

<p>I'd like to create a web application that makes it easy for anyone to
play with selecting their own graphemes for all the phonemes, interactively
displaying the resulting words' spellings.
</p>

<p>It would probably be more important to create a web app where you can paste the IPA spelling of a word, and get it converted.
</p>

<p>"Data", "those", "these" are plural?</p>

<p>Might be good to do something with she/her, he/him.  I've heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5H7uMq3mS8">young kids get these confused</a>, and maybe they're redundant?  (Always using "her", never "she", as in "Her was [doing something].")  These are subject and object pronouns?  Are there other similarly redundant words?  What other words do small children and adults learning English tend to get "wrong"?  "Us"/"we"?
Subject pronouns: I, we, you, he, she, it, or they.  Object pronouns:  me, us, you, him, her, it, and them.  
Old Norse "hann" means "him" or "he", so apparently this happens elsewhere.
</p>

<p>Make movie with this language for promotion, used similar to A Clockwork Orange, where they wanted a futuristic language?</p>

<hr />
<p>In an ideal situation, every sound would correspond to a single letter.
There are over 40 sounds in English, and 26 letters.  Often people
interested in this goal add more letters.  I'm curious about taking
away sounds, to have only 26 of them.  Somebody must have tried this,
but I have not yet found an example.  On 2014-11-17, Allan Kiisk said
that in the Estonian spelling reform, pronunciations adjusted to match
new phonetic spellings.
</p>


<hr />

<p>There was a successful Turkish spelling reform.  (Apparently made pronunciation more regular, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/59b21m/what_are_some_real_life_examples_of_government/d9827ne/">spelling less predictable</a>.)</p>

<p>Why "Terran English?"  "Terra" is a word for "Earth".  
I've read some neat stuff suggesting pride in being of this planet, instead of being of various countries.

<!-- Removed because these would be different for each language, and that would suck.
<hr />
For things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia">Simple English</a>, maybe it would be useful to try to use the words that are more common among more languages, to make them easier to learn?  For example, English "understand" = Spanish "entiendo", but for native speakers of one of those languages, it would be easier to learn: English "comprehend" = Spanish "comprendo".

<h2 id="prefixes">Inconsistent prefixes</h2>

<p>Not long ago, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP-65zKE_LM">a video</a>, I heard the word "impregnable".  And, even though I knew what all of the parts meant, I didn't know what the word meant.  Did the "im" prefix mean "into", as in "impregnate" and "immigration", or did it mean "not", as in "impenetrable" and "impossible"?  My guess was wrong, and this is a common problem in English.  
</p>

<p>So another potential improvement could be to replace inconsistent prefixes.  Like replacing all instances of the prefix "im" meaning "not" with the prefix "un".  Giving us "unpregnable", "unpenetrable", and "unpossible".
