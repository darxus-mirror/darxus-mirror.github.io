<title>My Obsessions</title>

<div>This section is still rather raw.<br />
<br />
I tend to be a bit obsessive. Go ahead and chuckle if you know me. It's true. I
know it. I'm okay with it. I think it goes well with my general
unreasonableness and short attention span.<br />
<br />
"I keep having these irrational bouts of obsessing on things." - Mom, 12/23/02.
It's genetic.<br />
<br />
There are a few obsessions that have... lasted long enough that I think they
might as well be documented:<br />

<td><a href="../car/index.html">The Car</a> - 81/82 vette - probably my most extreme
obsession - I want a 1981/1982 Chevrolet Corvette, painted gloss black, with
metallic black rally stripes, a black leather interior, a manual transmission,
and a rebuilt engine. As of 12/02, this seems very unlikely to happen within
the next few years.<br />
Mon Jun 21 N-tropy said he wanted a mini. (2004)<br />
Fri Jun 25 After reading history of minis, I became curious about
rallying.<br />
Sat Jun 26 Navigated in regisd's mini in a rally, I talked to people about
autocross.<br />
Mon Jun 28 Decided I wanted a '95 M3, largely for autocross.<br />
Sat Jul 3 Test drove a Mini S, very fun.<br />
Fri Jul 9 Seriously doubting the likelyhood of finding an M3, reconsidering
Mitsubishi Evolution.<br />
Sun Jul 11 Decided I wanted a bike - Suzuki SV650S. Evolutions are probably
crap, M3 would probably still be nice.<br />
I got a similar bike (below). I still think an M3 would be nice. (still
2004)</td>

I like to wear black leather boots (when I'm not barefoot or wearing sandals).
I wear 10 1/2 medium American, 44 European. I have owned (in chronological
order):
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.drmartens.com/FootweardetailTop.asp?setProd=595">8 hole
Dr. Martens (black greasy)</a> - relatively poor quality for boots, but a good
intruduction to them, I needed dr. scholl's (DynaStep?) inserts</li>
<li><a href=
"http://www.timberland.com/cgi-bin/timberland/timberland/catalog/tim_product_detail.jsp?OID=13754&amp;strCategory=/Men/Footwear/Boots">
Classic Timberlands</a> - heel support deformed from sitting in my car in the
sun for a couple weeks</li>
<li>Frye Harness 12R boots - the only ones on this list I don't still own
because both pair of them fell apart on me rather quickly, the second time I
had them replaced I got:</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fryeboots.com/ShopFrye.cfm?StyleNmbr=87635">Frye
Engineer Harness boots</a> - toes broke down way too easily</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coveshoe.com/ItemDisplay.asp?Style=1997">Matterhorn
#1997 All Weather boots</a> combat boots with arctic to desert appropriate
insulation - lived in probably for a couple years till I got my new rocks.
Wearing again while riding my motorcycle. These things are wonderful. Purchased
end of 2001 ?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.justinboots.com/boots/default.asp?id=1434">Justin
Boots, Black Corona boots</a> - for dressier occasions (got them
10/27/02).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cloggs.co.uk/Store/pages/272.html">New Rock model
272</a> ordered 10/20, shipped 10/21, recieved 10/29/03, now living in them.
Can't shift reasonably on my motorcycle due to thick sole.</li>
</ul>
I'm currently lusting over <a href=
"http://www.pennangalan.co.uk/boots/FW173.php">Pennangalan Transmuteres with
5.5" heels and AllyCat Spike panels with shiny metal plates</a> but their cost
is rather rediculous <tt>:(</tt><br />
And it looks like they stopped selling them between 11/21/03 and 12/1/03.<br />
Some people are <a href="http://www.hotboots.com/gallery.html">more obsessed
about boots</a> than me.</td>

just moved into happens to be about 4 blocks from a lake. So I need one. I'm
currently considering an <a href=
"https://www.oldtowncanoe.com/castine.html">Old Town Castine</a>, in green. I
hope to put one in the water soon, long before any sane person would do so for
the first time. And eskimo roll (once it gets warm). And then see if Monster
likes going with me. I'm hoping he'll enjoy sleeping on the bow in the fresh
air and sunshine on this calm lake.<br />
Was convinced to try renting a few times first. Two full summers later and I've
only done it once. Very thankful for that suggestion.</td>
