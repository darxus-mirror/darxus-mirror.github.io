<h1>Car and motorcycle wrenching tips</h1>

<p>Whenever you get a vehicle back from a mechanic, make sure you can get the wheels off.  Many of them tighten the lugs <i>way</i> too tight.  Once you get them off, use anti-sieze when putting them on.  It's very important that you then re-tighten them a while later, in case they worked loose, with aluminum wheels, after 20-25 miles.
</p>

<p>Whenver you take a bolt off, clean it up before you put it back on.  Repeatedly work it in and out of its hole, rinsing with something like WD40 each time, until it goes in easy.  Then lubricate it.  Anti-sieze is probably great for most things that aren't too hot, Permetex is popular.  Brake calipers are hot, and because of this require (very common) high temperature brake and caliper grease.  Marine grease is cheaper.
</p>

<p>Don't break bolts.  Turns out with along enough lever (like a 25" breaker bar), you can absolutely snap a bolt, like one of the bigger ones holding your brake calipers on.  Slow steady movements are apparently worse than short yanking movements.  Work it back and forth.  Possibly most importantly, use penetrating oil.  I've heard Kroil is better than PB Blaster, which is better than Liquid wrench.  Let them sit for a good while to work.  Might also be useful to whack the end of the bolt with a hammer, straight on, to help get it loose.
</p>

<p>Whenver you work on brake calipers, make sure that the parts that are supposed to move, move freely.  Many calipers have a half that slides back and forth on pins, which can get gummed up, and not want to slide.  Which seems to cause massive additional wear, resulting in replacing parts more often.  Take them apart, scrub them (brass brush and WD40?), maybe fil them if necessary, then grease as appropriate.  Apparently some you're not supposed to grease, some you need to use red rubber grease to avoid breaking down its rubber boot.
</p>

<p>Many brake rotor screws are very difficult to remove.  The Craftsman hammer driven manual impact driver is commonly recommended, especially for Honda's Phillips screws.  The Harbor Freight version is apparently too fragile.
</p>

<p>When replacing wipers, get "wiper refills" from a dealership.  They cost less, and you end up with higher quality wipers than if you buy new wipers from a local auto parts store. And they're still easy, just watch a youtube video.
